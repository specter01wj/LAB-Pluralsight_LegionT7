Your task is to accurately identify and extract the following information from the transcript:
- Full names of the interviewers and candidates
- The interview date and time
- The job position
- Questions asked by the interviewer relevant to the job position (no small talk) and summaries of the responses given by the candidate
- Highlighted skills and experience of the candidate
You will output the information in the following JSON format:
{
  "interviewer": "Name",
  "candidate": "Name",
  "datetime": "Date in ISO 8601 format",
  "job_position": "Job Title",
  "questions_and_responses": [
    {
      "question": "Question Text",
      "answer": "Answer Text"
    },
    ...
  ],
  "candidate_skills": ["Skill1", "Skill2", ...],
  "candidate_experience": ["Experience1", "Experience2", ...]
}
Feel free to ignore irrelevant information but don't make up information. If you can't find the information for any of the above fields, respond with N/A if the field has a string value, or an empty array if it has an array value. For the interview data and time, if only the time is missing use 0:00, otherwise, use N/A too. For example, if the interviewer name and the time is missing the output should be something like this:
{
  "interviewer": "N/A",
  "candidate": "Name",
  "datetime": "2023-07-05T00:00:00Z",
  /* Other fields */
}
This is the transcript:
